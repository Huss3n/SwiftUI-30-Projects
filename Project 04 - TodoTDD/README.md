# ToDo TDD
TodoTDD is a simple to do list iOS App. It is inspired by soap's ToDOTDD Dr. Dominik Hauser's book Test-Driven iOS Developement with Swift 4 
that demonstrates how to write unit / UI tests for UI components, network layer, data serizalization, and etc. by following the test driven development process. 
The code test coverage is 91.9%.
The app was written in Swift 5 and I used SwiftUI for the UI.

## Coredata
I have also added coredata storage for the app where the meetings can be stored on the users device and it will persist even when the app is restarted.
